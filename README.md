## About This Project

The **Claim Insights** system is a single-page web application designed to demonstrate an automated approach to medical claim denials analysis and prediction. Leveraging simulated historical data and predefined rules, it aims to provide actionable insights to healthcare providers to prevent future claim denials, optimize revenue cycles, and reduce administrative burden.

This project showcases the application of data analysis and predictive logic to a critical pain point in medical billing, making it a valuable addition to a data science and machine learning portfolio.

## Key Features

* **📊 Interactive Dashboard:** Visualizes key metrics such as denial rates over time, denials by reason, and aged accounts receivable using dynamic D3.js charts.

* **🔍 Denial Analysis:** Provides a detailed breakdown of common denial reasons and payer-specific patterns, helping identify root causes.

* **🔮 Simulated Claim Prediction:** Allows users to input new claim details and receive a simulated denial risk (High, Medium, Low) with an explanation and actionable recommendations.

* **🧹 Simulated Claim Scrubbing:** Features a "Claim Scrubbing" tool that identifies potential errors and flags high-risk factors in claim data before submission.

* **💰 Patient Financial Responsibility Estimation:** Estimates the patient's out-of-pocket cost based on simulated insurance rules, promoting upfront transparency.

* **📄 Payer Rule Hints:** Offers dynamic, context-aware guidance on payer-specific rules and common denial triggers as claim data is entered.

* **📱 Fully Responsive Design:** A modern, single-page interface that works seamlessly across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices, thanks to Tailwind CSS.

* **🚀 Pure Client-Side Stack:** Built with fundamental web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and D3.js, making it lightweight, fast, and ideal for static hosting on platforms like GitHub Pages.
